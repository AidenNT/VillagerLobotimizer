# ===== SENTRY ERROR TRACKING =====
# Sentry is an error monitoring service that helps developers identify and fix bugs proactively.
# When enabled, the plugin will automatically report crashes and exceptions to the developers.
#
# WHAT DATA IS COLLECTED:
#   - Exception stack traces and error messages
#   - Server type and version (Paper, Purpur, Folia, etc.)
#   - Minecraft version and Bukkit API version
#   - Java version
#   - Plugin version
#   - Thread information and task scheduling context
#
# WHAT DATA IS NOT COLLECTED:
#   - Player names, UUIDs, or any player-identifiable information
#   - Chat messages or commands
#   - World data, coordinates, or block information
#   - Server IP address or hostname
#   - Server configuration (beyond this plugin's settings)
#
# WHY KEEP THIS ENABLED:
#   - Helps developers discover and fix bugs you might not even report
#   - Provides context to fix issues specific to your server setup (Folia vs Paper, Java version, etc.)
#   - Errors are sent automatically - no need to manually report bugs
#   - All data is anonymized and used solely for debugging purposes
#
# PRIVACY: No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected. Only technical error data is sent.
#
# Set to false if you prefer not to share error reports with developers.
